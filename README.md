Learn REST by example
---------------------

Simple phonebook app to learn about RESTful app development and a lot of related technologies
(some of them are quite general and not RESTful related, but still are needed and are useful knowledge) :

* how to develop basic RESTful API with Python 3 / Pecan
* how to build python projects: setup.py / PBR / tox / py.test
* how to setup CI for the project: GitHub / Travis-CI / codecov / ...

And the learning possibilites are almost endless. You can tewak the project into many different directions:

* you can create a fancy UI for your RESTful service with React, Angular, ...
* you can reuse the business logic and learn other frameworks: Django, Flask, ...
* or even learn and do it in other programming languages: Java: Jersey, Spring Boot / Node.js: Express / ...
* learn about testing: BDD with Cucumber, performance testing with JMeter, ...
* instead of the simple in-memory backend use real databases: MongoDB, MariaDB, ...
* learn about software architecture best practices. 
  For example: create independent business logic which can be reused with different REST frameworks / databases
* how to deploy your app into different environments: AWS, OpenStack, ...
* how to create cloud native applications: put it into docker container(s) and run on kubernetes cluster, etc...
* security: setup https, ssl for secure communication, OAuth2 for authorization
* ...
